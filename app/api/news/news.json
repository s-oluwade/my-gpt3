        "content": "The third round of the BMW Championship took place on Saturday, with players jockeying for position or qualification in next week's 30-player field at the TOUR Championship.\n\nBelow, we'll break down three of the biggest storylines from Round 3.\n\nScheffler shot one of the best rounds from any golfer on Saturday, putting up a 6-under 64 to work his way into a three-way tie atop the leaderboard with Matt Fitzpatrick and Brian Harman.\n\nEven if he doesn't end up winning, he's put himself in excellent position to leapfrog Jon Rahm for the top overall seed in next week's TOUR Championship. Why does that matter?\n\nBecause the tournament will feature staggered starting scores depending upon a player's placement in the FedEx Cup standings coming into the event:\n\nNo. 1: 10-under par\nNo. 2: 8-under par\nNo. 3: 7-under par\nNo. 4: 6-under par\nNo. 5: 5-under par\nNos. 6-10: 4-under par\nNos. 11-15 start: 3-under par\nNos. 16-20: 2-under par\nNos. 21-25: 1-under par\nNos. 26-30: even\nHolding a multi-stroke advantage on the entire 30-player field, with the $18 million prize for the FedEx Cup champion on the line, is nothing to sneeze at. And now it's within striking distance for Scheffler.\n\nLast week, Rahm finished in a tie for 37th at the FedEx St. Jude Championship, shooting 5-under par.\n\nIt isn't looking much better this week.\n\nRahm shot a 1-over 71 on Saturday, his second straight round over par. He's now three strokes over par for the tournament and tied for 38th. His grip on the top overall seed in the TOUR Championship is slipping by the day.\n\nHe isn't going to win the BMW Championship. Now, he just needs to hope that somebody who could surpass him in the standings doesn't pick up enough points to claim the top overall seed.\n\nBut it isn't looking good.",

        "content": "Action MMO Wayfinder is entering early access on PlayStation and PC, and it’s an intriguing take on the fantasy post-apocalypse. It does have a typical gameplay loop: Exploring dungeons, slaying foes, finding loot, choosing upgrades, and collecting currencies. Combat is fast, fluid, and dynamic, allowing players to choose different character archetypes and playstyles. The other big draw of Wayfinder is that players have a customizable place to rest after a long day in the murder mines.\n\n“One of the biggest influences was Lord of the Rings Online,” says design director Steve Madueria in a call with Polygon. “We had really fun memories, because they had shared neighborhoods. We went into neighborhoods together, picking up house plots, seeing what changes our friends made — that feeling is something we wanted to capture because it was such a strong social element.”\n\nWhile the game is just entering early access, its developers at Airship Syndicate are already sketching out plans for the next few years of potential content. For now, players can claim and customize their own humble apartments in the city of Skylight. These apartments can be personalized and furnished to the player’s liking, and they can store powerful artifacts that provide buffs when players are away from home.\n\n“The house being more of a house, being an extension of your character, something you build on and improve your character and friends — that was always part of the design,” adds AJ LaSaracina, marketing director at Airship Syndicate. Wayfinder provides the chill aspect of decorating a house and planning the perfect breakfast nook — plus, those housing benefits pay off in a tangible way through character buffs.\n\nIn the early stages of Wayfinder, the housing will be something a player can customize on their own before inviting their pals over to take a gander. As development progresses, Airship Syndicate plans to add neighborhoods and more collaborative features to housing. Some of these features are actively being prototyped and tested behind the scenes.\n\nFor now, players just have their rustic apartments, which give them a base to rest and familiarize themselves with the core systems. There are some fun pieces of furniture available that don’t have a function but just look neat to have around — for instance, a ferocious mimic-style chest that snaps its massive jaws, or a mounted bear head that roars at passersby.\n\n“We don’t want to give you so much space early on that you feel like you need so much to make it feel cozy,” says Madueria. “You can decorate with a lesser amount of stuff and make it feel nice and homey, then have the room to expand that.”\n\nThe smaller scale of apartments also allows Airship Syndicate to ease players in. Starting out with a mansion and vast gardens would be overwhelming, and it wouldn’t gel with the vibe of the rest of the game — after all, this is a world that barely held off from collapse, and it’s still under assault from the terrible gloom. Since housing also offers gameplay benefits (due to the artifacts that provide buffs to characters), keeping it small to start makes sense; players can take advantage of those benefits without needing to get too deep into home decor.\n\nArtifacts do come with a power cost, and each home has a budget. Players can have a selection of small artifacts with helpful effects, or one big one that gives a powerful buff. Artifacts can be switched on and off, and they’re good for different scenarios. If you’re a solo player, you might want ones that give you – and only you – extra speed or additional gold drops. Playing with friends? It might be worth grabbing an artifact that provides an area-of-effect buff when you double jump.\n\nThe game’s developers are also looking to add fishing, cooking, blacksmithing, and other activities that players can do at their homes before heading out into the field. Their goal is to have the world of Wayfinder be a place to hang out with pals, instead of just an avenue to queue up a conga line of killing things.\n\nWayfinder’s early access launch means the game is still very new, but publisher Digital Extremes’ history with long-running MMO Warframe will be a useful asset when it comes to addressing feedback and adding new features. So far, I’m interested to see where this world goes — and having a little home to call my own is a bonus.",

He completed 7 of 12 passes for 67 yards and one interception and rushed for seven yards on two carries in one quarter of action.\n\nThe Colts selected Richardson with the fourth overall pick in the 2023 draft out of Florida. He told reporters this week that he was 'shocked' to be named the starter over Minshew and Sam Ehlinger.\n\nColts head coach Shane Steichen said of the decision to name Richardson QB1:\n\nThe Colts are hoping they struck gold with Richardson, who is expected to be their quarterback of the future, after years of inefficiency at the position following Andrew Luck's abrupt retirement ahead of the 2019 season.\n\nRichardson not suiting up for Saturday's preseason game against the Bears isn't a cause for concern, though teams typically like to give rookies more reps during the preseason to get acclimated to the NFL.\n\nAdditionally, Richardson only started 13 games during his career at Florida, so he likely would have benefitted from some extra playing time.\n\nWe could still see Richardson again this summer. The Colts have one final preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Aug. 24 before opening the regular season against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sept. 10.",

        "content": "An institution has offered a $1.6 million prize to anyone who can solve a famous maths problem that has puzzled mathematicians for more than a century.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis, first proposed by German mathematician Bernhard Riemann in 1859, is considered to be one of the hardest and most important unsolved problems of pure mathematics — the study of thinking about maths, rather than applying it to the real world.\n\nThe hypothesis is based on the Riemann zeta function, also attributed to Bernhard Riemann. It states: “The real part of every nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2”.\n\nThe answer to the Riemann hypothesis is a simple “yes” or “no”, but there are many hypothetical ways to get there, all of which are extremely difficult.\n\nIf the answer is yes, it would have huge implications for number theory, encryption and the study of prime numbers, which is why the Riemann hypothesis is sometimes called the “holy grail of mathematics”.\n\nThere is a lot of good evidence that leads mathematicians to believe the Riemann hypothesis is true, but it still needs to be proven.\n\nWhy is the Riemann hypothesis important?\n\nIf the Riemann hypothesis is true, it would provide groundbreaking insights into the workings of prime numbers.\n\nMathematician, comedian and former teacher Matt Parker explained in 2010 that experts are “obsessed with primes because they are the foundation of all other numbers”.\n\n“Prime numbers in mathematics are like atoms in chemistry, bricks in the construction industry and ludicrous pay cheques in professional football,” he said.\n\n“Everything is built up from these fundamental units and you can investigate the integrity of something by taking a close look at the units from which it is made.\n\n“To investigate how a number behaves you look at its prime factors, for example 63 is 3 x 3 x 7. Primes do not have factors: they are as simple as numbers get.”\n\nOn the other hand, if the Riemann hypothesis is not true, it would usurp much of what humans believe about mathematics.\n\nAs explained by South African mathematician Peter Sarnak: “If (the Riemann Hypothesis) is not true, then the world is a very different place … In a way, it would be more interesting if it were false, but it would be a disaster because we’ve built so much around assuming its truth.”\n\nSeveral mathematicians have addressed the Riemann hypothesis across its 164-year history, but none of their attempts has been accepted as proof. The Clay Mathematicians Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts has offered US$1 million (A$1.6 million) to anyone who can verifiably solve the problem.",

We just don’t know yet,” he said.\n\nImmunologist Kristian Anderson wrote on Twitter it has all the “hallmark features of something that could take off, however, our immunity landscape is now complex, so it’s too early to say it will”.\n\nHe concluded by saying “I think it might”.\n\nExperts believe most people have some level of “immune memory” which will allow their immune system to kick in and control the infection effectively.\n\nThe symptoms appear to be similar to those caused by previous strains, Thomas Russo, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Buffalo medical school, told the Sydney Morning Herald.",

Rather than paying streamers to sleep, viewers pay to keep streamers awake. By donating money, people can trigger loud noises, alerts, flicker lights, or make things happen in a room to disturb the streamer from their siesta.\n\nThese videos are like a live-action video game, in which the streamer is simply trying to fall asleep and the players - or the viewers - are doing whatever they can to wake them up.\n\nThe trend started on TikTok and it features \"sleepfluencers\" like Jakey Boehm and Stanley - aka StanleyMov - who says he makes enough from his occasional sleep streams to pay his rent.\n\n",

It was a tough event, but hopefully, better for the future and I'm glad to have achieved that goal.\"\n\nDouglas is coming off a stellar Olympic debut in Tokyo where her sixth-place finish in the one-person dinghy category was the best individual performance at an Olympics by a Canadian woman in the sport.\n\nWhile the 29-year-old clinched a spot for Canada, no individual athlete met the Sail Canada selection process criteria to automatically qualify themselves in ILCA 6 for the 2024 Games.\n\nIn order to do so, the athlete with the lowest score combined position from the 2024 worlds in their respective classes and the 2024 Princess Sofia Regatta, added together, will be selected based on a sailing scoring system, which is lowest score first.\n\nIn the case of a tie, the athlete or team in the higher position, based on the sailing scoring system, at the 2024 Princess Sofia Regatta will qualify to be nominated. If an event is cancelled, it will be replaced by the 2024 European championships of the class.\n\n'I was able to claw my way back'\nDouglas got off to a rocky start last Sunday with a penalty in the first of 10 women's dinghy races, but was able to string together a bevy of solid results — including a fourth-place finish in the fourth race and a fifth-place finish in the sixth race — throughout the week to ultimately clinch the 16th and final Olympic spot available at worlds in the ILCA 6 category.\n\n\"Starting with a penalty in the first race at the world championships is not easy,\" Douglas said. \"It's [definitely] challenging mentally as well to come back from that. I really pushed and tried, and I had a little bit of inconsistency in my racing, but I climbed up the leaderboard every day and did put together some pretty good races. It was a tough start, but I was able to claw my way back.\"\n\nThe 10-athlete medal race on Sunday — which Douglas did not qualify for — will wrap up the women's dinghy event and close out the world championships, with the men's dinghy medal race being the only other event on the schedule on the last day of competition.\n\nThe qualification window for sailing at the Paris Olympics opened with the sailing worlds this week, and will run though the rest of 2023 into 2024, with 312 quota spots up for grabs.\n\nThe 2023 Pan American Games taking place in in Santiago, Chile, from Oct. 28 to Nov. 5 will be Canada's next opportunity to add a qualifying spot at the Games, by virtue of being the top nation that has not already qualified.\n\nCanada last won an Olympic sailing medal in Athens in 2004 when Mike Wolfs and Ross MacDonald collected silver in the men's star event, one of nine medals (three silver, six bronze) won by Canada in sailing at the Olympics.",

He said the festival gives him a place to share his talent and hard work with the public. \n\nTwo young artists at the festival said they found their craft by helping others.\n\nAngel Leblanc and Goodness Olugo raised $144 for the IWK Health Centre by selling bracelets and earrings they made.\n\nThe two friends have continued to make jewelry to help raise awareness of their missing friend, Devon Marsman. \n\n\"We don't really get that much for ourselves. It's mostly for the Devon fund,\" LeBlanc said.\n\nErnst said Independent Living Nova Scotia rents the space for the festival and doesn't charge artists any vendor fees.\n\nShe said the building was accessible to all artists and visitors and an online catalogue was made available to anyone who couldn't attend.",

The department says the proponent is allowed to conduct monitoring work, but not to apply the pesticide itself without further authorization. \n\nNeville Crabbe, the working group's spokesperson, told CBC News last week there isn't a plan to continue spraying, but the group was \"in discussions\" about the next step.\n\nWhen asked if lake residents were well-informed about the spraying, Crabbe said yes. But a group of four cottagers said they feel differently. \n\nScott Bell, a cottage owner who has lived on the lake his whole life, said when the project first was slated to go ahead in 2021, the working group was in communications with residents for the first year.\n\n\"Then they pretty much cut off communications and became very closed-mouth, secretive,\" Bell said. \"We've lost a lot of trust in Neville Crabbe.\"\n\nCrabbe did not return a request for an interview about the cottager's concerns, but had told CBC News in an email last week that the working group would not be making any more public comments until there was clear direction on the project.\n\nGreenlaw said this summer has been stressful, wondering when and if the spraying will continue.\n\n\"It's not the same out here,\" Greenlaw said, \"Knowing that the hammer might be dropping.\"\n\nBell has similar sentiments.\n\n\"I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about it,\" he said. \"It's always on your mind.\"",

However, there has been no headway yet.<br>This is the is first round of talks after Ulfa rejected a draft peace proposal from the Centre in May last on the ground that it does not cater to its principle demands of political and constitutional safeguards for the indigenous people of Assam with definite certainty. This is the first draft peace agreement from the Centre nearly 12 years after the start of the peace dialogue with the outfit.<br>The outfit's general secretary, Anup Chetia, told TOI, \"There is need for more discussions. The picture will be clearer only after some time. The focus now is on discussions and the next round will be held very soon\" <br>The four-member team of Ulfa was led by its 'chairman' Arabinda Rajkhowa. Besides Chetia, the other members present were Sasadhar Choudhury and Raju Barua. From the government's side, the team was led by interlocutor AK Mishra and had officials of MHA in the team.<br>The draft peace deal was based on Ulfa's 12-point charter of demands submitted in 2011, which includes \"constitutional and political arrangements and reforms, protection of the identity and material resources of the local indigenous population of Assam\" and \"land and natural resources, including the right of natives to the land.\"<br>Based on the charter of demands, the tripartite discussions were held for 12 years before the Centre's interlocutor AK Mishra in April last handed Ulfa the draft agreement. The draft does include land rights for indigenous people as demanded by the outfit but not the safeguards for the political and constitutional rights of indigenous people, which is a political issue. Ulfa was formed in 1979 for \"restoration of Assam's sovereignty\" and was banned by the Centre in 1990. The outfit split after the pro-talks faction led by Rajkhowa joined peace talks on September 3, 2011.\"",

All is not well between chief minister Eknath Shinde and deputy chief ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar.

People are fully aware that all three came together for the lust of power and are stooping to the lowest levels for it.\"\nResponding to his jibe, Bawankule said all senior BJP functionaries and Fadnavis had clarified many times that Shinde would remain their leader till 2024 polls. \"Even the assembly polls would be fought under Shinde as CM's face. All three parties (Shinde Sena, BJP and NCP) would work under him and we would win over 200 assembly seats. Even now, the government is working with over 200 legislators and Shinde will remain our leader,\" Bawankule said.\nOn Wadettiwar and other Congress functionaries' claim that the BJP's central leadership was targeting Union minister Nitin Gadkari through the CAG report where strictures were passed against NHAI regarding additional expenditure in the construction of Dwarka Expressway, Bawankule termed it an attempt by the opposition to create confusion.\n\"The opposition may try their best, but they cannot unnerve Gadkari. We remain united in BJP unlike Congress, which is itself battling internal differences,\" he said.\nOn Shiv Sena (UBT) mouthpiece Saamna's article flaying Fadnavis, Bawankule warned that a case would be filed against them for defaming BJP politicians and that party cadres will hit the streets to protest the article. \"This is a misuse of the freedom granted to the media. There is a limit to everything. We will not tolerate such lies about our leaders. It shows Uddhav Thackeray's frustration after losing the chief minister's chair, his partymen and even his symbol.\"\nSaamna editorial said Fadnavis was a sensitive person earlier, but after becoming 'deputy' (chief minister) he lost his sensitivity and became a giant of ego. It further said that the inferiority complex of being the 'deputy' of the 'chief' has upset him (Fadnavis).",

        "content": "South Africa's flyhalf was generally accomplished as play-maker on a day where the team scored eight tries in a 52-16 dismantling of Wales in Cardiff. However, there remain reservations over having the Stormers star as the only front-line goal-kicker in the squad for the showpiece.\n\nLibbok spurned no less than 10 points from the kicking tee - missing two conversions and two penalties - with the real concern being the fact that a few of his attempts weren't particularly taxing.\n\nHowever, team management would also reasonably argue that it's more important to back Libbok in context-less warm-up matches for him to build the type of confidence that would see him nail the points on offer when the stakes are at their highest.\n\nIf push comes to shove, a variety of other candidates such as Cheslin Kolbe, Damian Willemse and Faf de Klerk can provide stop-gap service off the tee. \n\nAsked what his plan would be if Libbok's radar is off in future, Nienaber pithily answered: \"We'd just tell him to keep firing shots. Keep going. Simple as that.\"\n\nIt's a remark that will probably leave some observers uncomfortable though goal-kicking also doesn't matter too much when you're visiting the tryline regularly.\n\nDespite the emphatic scoreline, the Bok mentor still believes his troops have numerous work-ons, particularly related to capitalising more ruthlessly on opportunities for points as well as continued problems with discipline.\n\nEleven penalties (and a yellow card for Willemse for a head-on-head clash) indeed felt high for a team that had so much dominance in the game.\n\n\"There were a few opportunities we left unused, especially in the first half. When you're playing in a tough environment like the World Cup, you can't afford to let those chances go begging,\" said Nienaber.\n\n\"Our discipline, particularly in the second half, wasn't up to standard. I felt it wasn't better illustrated than early after the break when we conceded a scrum penalty in Wales' 22, were penalised again at the lineout, gave them entry in our 22, where we infringed again and were ultimately 'saved' by Pieter-Steph's intercept and try. \n\n\"You simply can't allow sequences of play like that in the World Cup, where opponents are going to punish you. We'll have to be better.\"\n\nThe Welsh kicking game again exposed some jitteriness in terms of the Boks' ability to field those bombs forward though Nienaber pointed out that the players' ability to \"find solutions to that during the game\" was encouraging.\n\nHe also lauded his charges' intensity and intent on attack.\n\nUnderstandably given South Africa's headaches with officiating over the past two years, Nienaber refused to comment on what was an admittedly harsh yellow for home winger Rio Dyer for a deliberate knockdown that led to two tries within a minute for the visitors.\n\n\"I'll get into trouble. We just trust the process. We can't make media comments,\" he said.\n\n\"We trust the process in terms of the new bunker system. We had their communications feed throughout the game and I felt the communication between the referees was outstanding. They said from the outset: this is a big decision, we need to take our time.\n\n\"They did that and the process that was followed to get to the outcome was good. You can't fault them for that.\"",

        "content": "Starting secondary school is a big milestone for a child. This new beginning can bring a mix of excitement and anxiety for first year students.\n\nPerhaps your child’s friendship group is being sundered by the move to secondary – they are certainly going to be a smaller fish in a bigger pond.\n\nAnd then there’s a raft of new social codes and unspoken rules to navigate about what’s cool and what’s not. Sixth class was so much easier.\n\nParents can support their teenager by talking to them about how they feel, says paediatric psychologist Dr Claire Crowe who is a member of the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.\n\nFirst, you’ll need to get in position to lay the groundwork.\n\n“I would recommend taking opportunities when you are alongside one another, such as walking or driving to bring it up,” says Crowe. “Your child is likely to feel less self-conscious discussing their feelings in the absence of eye contact,” she says.",

Decisions to close selected schools will be taken on a case-by-case basis, and the school in question will inform parents.\"\n\nThe department said rumours that schools were being targeted spread wildly on Monday, resulting in panic and confusion.\n\n\"No school has reported such an incident. We appeal to the public not to share fake news. Adding to the uncertainty is irresponsible and puts our learners at risk.\"\n\nThe department urged school communities to report any harassment or intimidation of pupils, so that appropriate legal action could be taken.\n\n\"We will not tolerate anyone preventing our children from accessing their constitutional right to education,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, City of Cape Town Mayco member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, said law enforcement arrested nine people for public violence and protests in Kraaifontein. \n\nHe said at least 44 people were arrested in total on Monday.\n\nSmith said law enforcement monitored the demonstrations and sporadic incidents of unrest in parts of the city, including in hotspot areas including Philippi, Khayelitsha, Kraaifontein and the N7. He said the City of Cape Town also removed tyres and debris left over from protests.\n\n\"We are also aware of numerous threats against city facilities, infrastructure and staff and are keeping a close watch to mitigate any risks that may arise,\" he said.\n\nThe City's traffic services said around 17:00 that the R300 and Jakes Gerwel Drive were reopened to traffic.\n\nSmith asked residents with information about perpetrators of violence and unrest to report them anonymously on 0800 110077.",

        "content": "A UN index measuring global food prices has risen for the first time since April following the collapse of the Ukraine grain deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan later this month to discuss restarting the deal.\n\nFor more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org\nTurkey’s Hürriyet Daily News reported on Monday that Putin and Erdoğan spoke on the phone last week and agreed that Putin would visit Turkey at the end of August. A specific date has not been released.\n\nAfter invading Ukraine in February 2022, Russia enforced a naval blockade, cutting off Ukrainian exports. The embargo caused a steep rise in prices for agricultural products. In July 2022, Russia and Ukraine signed the Black Sea Grain Initiative, an agreement brokered by the UN and Turkey to establish a safe shipping corridor and allow Ukrainian exports to resume. Last month, Russia pulled out of the agreement.\n\nAccording to the report, Erdoğan and his Cabinet are discussing ways to resume the deal.\n\nA view shows a grain warehouse destroyed by a Russian missile strike, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, at a compound of an agricultural company in the village of Pavlivka, in Odesa region, Ukraine July 21, 2023.

(credit: REUTERS/Nina Liashonok)\nGlobal food prices continue to rise\nOn Saturday, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization released its monthly Food Price Index, which found that global food prices had risen 1.3% from June. The change, which the report attributed to “the Russian Federation’s decision to end implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative,” was the first increase in the index since April.\n\nFarhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, described the grain deal as “indispensable” last month and said that it helped decrease food prices, which had risen dramatically following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWith global food prices now rising again, Putin has faced pressure to return to the agreement.\n\nAydin Sezer, a foreign policy analyst based in Ankara, said that Turkey’s reliance on Ukrainian grain makes the country especially invested in restarting the deal.\n\nThe disruption has been hitting Turkish flour mills hard, he said, increasing food costs in an economy already facing inflation.\n\nSezer said that resuming the grain deal would be a boon for Turkey and for Erdoğan.\n\n“It will be Erdoğan’s diplomatic success, but more importantly, Turkey will be able to buy grain from Ukraine,” Sezer wrote in a message to The Media Line.\n\nIn another phone call earlier this month, Erdoğan called on Putin to restart the deal. According to a readout of the call, Erdoğan told Putin that suspending the grain deal would not benefit anyone and referred to the deal as a “bridge of peace.”\n\nLast week, Russia attacked infrastructure that helped Ukraine export grain, including a major port.\n\nCaroline Bain, chief commodities economist for Capital Economics, told The Media Line that she did not expect the agreement to resume. She noted that other factors were also driving the rise in grain prices, including weather and protectionist policies of some other countries.\n\nAlthough supply has decreased, prices will probably stabilize around where they are now and are unlikely to return to the record highs they reached when Russia first invaded Ukraine, she said.\n\nDuring last week’s phone call, Erdoğan said that Turkey would continue its diplomatic efforts to support the grain deal, noting that the rising grain prices resulting from the deal’s breakdown are hurting the poorest countries the most. According to the readout of the call, he also called on Russia to avoid further escalation in the war. “No one should take any steps that would increase tension,” he said.\n\nRussia’s state news agency reported that Putin told Erdoğan that he blamed the West for the breakdown of the deal.\n\nLast month, EU officials met to discuss ways to get grain out of Ukraine, such as sending grain by land to ports in Lithuania and the Baltics. Bain said that these measures would increase costs, causing problems, especially for North African countries like Egypt that rely on Ukrainian grain.\n\nShe said that Russia, which also exports grain, would likely ensure that its allies in Africa and the Middle East had an adequate supply.\n\n“It doesn’t look good for Putin that he is potentially depriving more countries of basic food,” she said.\n\n",
